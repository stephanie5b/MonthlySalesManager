# MonthlySalesManager

The Monthly Sales Manager is an interactive program that helps manage and analyze monthly sales data over a 12-month period. It offers features like viewing monthly sales, calculating yearly totals, calculating monthly averages, and editing individual monthly sales data.

Features
Display Menu: Upon launch, the program displays a menu to guide users on available commands.

View Monthly Sales: Users can view sales data for each month.

Yearly Sales Report: The program calculates and displays the total yearly sales and the average monthly sales (rounded to 2 decimal places).

Edit Monthly Sales: Users have the flexibility to edit the sales data for any given month. The month's name should be given in its three-letter abbreviation (e.g., "Jan" for January). Invalid or improperly formatted month names will trigger an error message.

Persistent Data: Any edits made to the monthly sales data are immediately saved to the monthly_sales.csv file, ensuring no data loss.

Repeat Commands: Users can repeat any commands multiple times during a session.

Exit: Users can safely exit the program, which displays a farewell message "Bye!".

How to Use
Navigate to the program folder.
Run the sales.py program.
Follow the on-screen menu to utilize the features.

Note on CSV File
The monthly_sales.csv file within the data folder contains the sales data for 12 months. Users are free to edit the sales data through the program, but by the end of your operations, ensure the CSV file contains data for all 12 months.
